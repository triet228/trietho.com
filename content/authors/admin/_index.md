Hello hello, welcome to my website! My name is Triet Ho. I'm excited to have you here 😀

A little bit of my background, I was born and raised for the first 14 years of my life in Vietnam. My family immigrated to America in 2019 when I was in 9th grade. After that, I went to Pacifica High School (2022) and UC Irvine for undergraduate (2025), both are in Orange County, California. 

Currently, I'm a 1st year Ph.D. Student at Univeristy of Michigan (Umich) majoring in Aerospace Engineering. At Umich, I work under Professor Gökçin Çınar in [Integrated Design of Efficient Aerospace Systems (IDEAS) Lab](https://www.gokcincinar.com/authors/triet-ho/).

In the future, I want to work at NASA as a researcher. It's been my childhood dream to work at NASA. Back in the day, NASA TV programs were the first motivation for me to love science and eventually pursue Aerospace Engineering degree.
