        My research goal is to combine Machine Learning, Computational Research, and Aerospace Engineering together. Specifically, I focus on applying Machine Learning to Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) for Electricfied Aircraft. 

        Currently, I'm interested in generating hybrid propulsion architectures for Hybrid Electric Aircrafts (HEAs) using Generative Graph Neural Networks (GenGNNs). Designing a hybrid propulsion architectures is a discrete combinatorial task requiring decisions on the number of components, the specific type of each component, and the topology of their connections. Therefore, it's a challenging problem for traditional optimization algorithm. I see a good oportunity in this problem because we can take advantage of data-informed architectures generation from GenGNNs, filter them down, and optimize until we get novel hybrid propulsion architectures.
