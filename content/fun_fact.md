I draw this cat everywhere I go. Overtime, it has become my symbol. So if you ever see this cat again, you know it's Triet's related.

In 2018, I was in 8th grade. I had to miss a day of English class because of sickness. Therefore, I borrowed notebook from the best student in the class. In her note, I saw a cat. I copied it over to my note and it becomes the first version of Triet's cat. 

<img src="/trietcat/Triet_cat1.jpg" alt="Triet's Cat" width="300" style="background: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;">

In 2024, I was in 2nd year Undergrad at UC Irvine. When I took Writing 60, I draw the cat on the white board in a corner. In the next class, someone modified Triet's cat with stars around it. And even more, in the very next class, they add dots around the stars. This is the second version of Triet's cat

In the same quarter, I was sitting next to Jolyne in Math 3D with Prof. Pavlos Kalantzopoulos. In one of the lecture, professor said "important things are in the box" and he boxed the important formula. Taking inspiration from this and with approval from Jolyne, I added the box into Triet's cat. This is Triet's cat 3.0

The current Triet's cat is the same as the 3.0 version with slight modification of specific numbers of stars and dots inside and outside the box. There are specifically exactly 4 stars and 7 dots inside the box, and 1 dot is outside the box. These numbers were chosen by Jolyne from a specific instant of the 3.0 version.

This version has been used extensively for a long time now. Recently when I switch Operating System from Windows to Arch Linux, I replace Arch logo in neofetch with this cat.

In 2025, Ricky proposed to me 3D version of Triet's cat. This could potentially the 4.0 version. I will work on it if I have time.
